## Get started.
You will need python3 installed for the above. But, any local dev server cli tool may work.

1. Run a local server in the directory with index.html
	``` python3 -m http.server 9000```

2. Visit your browser at *127.0.0.1:9000*

## Development
You need to restart the local serve everytime for changes to propagate. Using [livereload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/livereload) in Step #1 of getting started may resolve this issue.
