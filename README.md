# Sydney-Storybook

## Get started.

1. Run a local server in the directory with index.html installed.
	``` python3 -m http.server 9000```

	You will need python3 installed for the above. But, any local dev server cli tool may work.

2. Vist your browser at *127.0.0.1:9000*

3. You need to restart the local serve everytime for changes to propagate. Using livereload in Step #1 may resolve this issue.
